Network Recon Methodology:
1. Host discovery (nmap, nc, ping sweep, scan.sh)
2. Port discovery (nmap, nc, scan.sh)
3. Port validation (banner grab -nc)
4. Follow on a ctions based on the ports found
4a. if it 21 or 80, wget -r IP or wget -r ftp://IP
4b. if its 22 or 23, connect to it and do passive recon

Scanning Methodoly:
quick scan ports 21-23 80
Well known port: 1-1023
Chuck of 200 or scan first 10000

Passive recon methodology
1. Hostname
2. Interfaces and subnets, ip a, ifconfig
3. Neighbors: arp -a, ip neigh
4. Files of interest: find
5. Other ports listening? ss -nftp
6. Tools? which, tcpdump, wireshark, nmap, telnet, wget, curl, nc
6a. We may have to sniff for additional creds in the clear if hinded to do so(use tcpdump to sniff for telnet traffic)
7. find / -name hint* 2> /dev/null
find / -name flag* 2> /dev/null
tcpdump -XXA port 23 (sniff for passwords in the clear only if suggested)
