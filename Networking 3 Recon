Network Recon: 

Methods of Recon: Active, passive, internal, external

Active: sending packets, very loud
Passive: Listening to the network, takes longer, quieter
Internal: DNS Queries, ARP Requests, Packet Sniffers
External: Network scanning, DNS Lookups, Whois, Job Site Listings

Passive More:

Gathering info about targets without direct interaction
Not as straight forward, and requres more thime than active
Lower risk of discovery

Passive recon involves identifying:
#IP addresses and Sub-Domains
#External and 3rd part sties
#People and tech
#Content of interest
#Vulnerabilities

Possible Tools for gathering:
#WHOIS queries
#Job site listings
#Phone numbers
#Google searches
#Passive OS fingerprinting

Passive external network recon:

#Info gathered outside the network using passive methods
#Allows for more efficient attacks and plans

#DNS#

Resolves hostnames to IP addresses
RFC 3912
WHOIS queries

#DIG#

Typically between primary and secondary DNS servers
If allowed to transfer externally, hostnames, IPs, and IP blocks can be determined

#Zone Transfer#
Returns DNS info
Supplements base queries

#Host History#
Netcraft
Wayback machine

#Google Dorking#
Useful to find subdomains, technologies

#Shodan#
Reveals info about tech,remote access services, improperly configured services, and newtork infrastructer
When selected can give additional inof and applicable vulnerabilites

Network Scanning:
Scannning Strategies
#Remote to local
#Local to remote
#Local to local
#Remote to remote

Scanning Approaches
#Aim
Wide range target scan
Target specific scan
#Method
Single source scan
Distributed scan

Network Scanning:
#Broadcast Ping and Ping Sweep (a denied response implies the presence of a device and the type of device)
#ARP scan (sending ARP requests on the local network to see what's there)
#SYN Scan (SYN packet, looking for existence, banner grabbing from listening service, no info on service since no handshake)
#Full connect scan(Louder and can be analyzed by the target network)
#Null scan(TCP packet with no flag set, can be used to avoid firewalls)
#FIN Scan(Trying to close a connection that doesn't exist, slightly stealthy, can avoidfirewalls)
#XMAS tree scan(FIN/PHS/URG or all flags set packet)
#UDP scan (Used to avoid statefull firewalls)
#ACK/Window scan
#RPC scan
#FTP scan
#Decoy scan
#OS fingerprinting scan(Able to guess at what the OS of the target box is)
#Version scan(Determine what services are running and their service)
#Protocol Ping
#Discovery Probes
